# BlogAPI
Blog Api for my gatsby site that is built with django and django Rest Framework

To get the site up and running ðŸš€
```
pipenv install # install dependencies
python manage.py makemigration
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver # The server should be now runnind on port 8000.
```
NB! You have to configure postrSQL or any other relational database for that matter.

Currently in development and the backend lacks features...
That said I will be adding some more features like sorting post by category and year.
